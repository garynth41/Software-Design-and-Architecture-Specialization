# Design Patterns


# About this Course
This course extends object-oriented analysis and design by incorporating design patterns to create interactive applications. Through a survey of established design patterns, you will gain a foundation for more complex software applications. Finally, you will identify problematic software designs by referencing a catalog of code smells.

You will be challenged in the Capstone Project to redesign an existing Java-based Android application to implement a combination of design patterns. You will also critique a given Java codebase for code smells.


# After completing this course, you will be able to: 
- Demonstrate how to use design patterns to address user interface design issues.	
- Identify the most suitable design pattern to address a given application design problem.	
- Apply design principles (e.g., open-closed, dependency inversion, least knowledge).	
- Critique code by identifying and refactoring anti-patterns.
- Apply the model-view-controller architectural pattern.
