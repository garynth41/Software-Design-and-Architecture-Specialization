# Service-Oriented Architecture

# About this Course
Based on an understanding of architectural styles, you will review architectures for web applications, then explore the basics of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) in two approaches: Web Services (WS*) and Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture. 

In the Capstone Project you will connect a Java-based Android application with Elasticsearch, a web service with a REST application programmer interface (API).

# After completing this course, you will be able to: 
- Describe SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) to structure web-based systems.
- Explain WS* services (i.e., SOAP over HTTP, WSDL, UDDI, BPEL).	
- Apply REST architecture (i.e., JSON over HTTP, URI).	
- Identify REST design principles.	
- Create a system using REST interfaces.	
- Apply microservice architecture.
