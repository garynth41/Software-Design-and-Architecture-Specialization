# Week 1

# Object-Oriented Analysis and Design

# Dr. Kenny Wong
Good software design begins before coding. After establishing the initial software requirements, design practices involve two main activities: conceptual design and technical design. In this module, you will realize the importance of design and object-oriented thinking, and learn how to design software using techniques like CRC cards.



# Learning Objectives:
* Apply the CRC (Class Responsibility Collaborator) technique to analyze and design the object-oriented model for a problem.
* Articulate the difference between design and architecture.
* Describe ‘design phase’ as a necessary transition step between problem description and solution implementation.
* Differentiate uses of the word ‘design’: (1) design as phase in development process, (2) design as work-product (UML diagram)
* Describe large scale designs, and small scale designs.
* Explain how qualities are often tradeoffs, balancing competing qualities.
* Demonstrate how to breakdown a problem in terms that a customer can understand.
* Demonstrate using index cards to help represent the breakdown of the problem where each card notes a specific concept (class) and its responsibilities and collaborators (dependencies to other concepts/classes).
